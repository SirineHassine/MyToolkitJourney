# AWS CodeBuild
AWS CodeBuild is a fully managed continuous integration service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that compiles source code, runs tests, and produces software packages that are ready for deployment. It is designed to automate the building of applications and streamline the software development process. Hereâ€™s a detailed overview of its key features, benefits, and use cases:

## Key Features
### Fully Managed Build Service: 
CodeBuild automatically scales to meet the demands of your build processes, eliminating the need to manage build servers or infrastructure.

### Support for Multiple Programming Languages: 
It supports a wide range of programming languages and frameworks, including Java, Python, Ruby, Go, Node.js, and more, allowing for diverse application builds.

### Custom Build Environments: 
CodeBuild allows you to create custom build environments using Docker images. You can define your build environment specifications and dependencies through a buildspec.yml file.

### Integration with Other AWS Services: 
CodeBuild integrates seamlessly with other AWS services, such as:

- AWS CodePipeline: For creating CI/CD pipelines that automate the entire software release process.
- AWS CodeCommit: For source control and version management.
- AWS CodeDeploy: For deploying built applications to various environments.

### Automatic Scaling: 
CodeBuild scales automatically to handle multiple concurrent builds, ensuring that build times are minimized, regardless of the size of your team or number of projects.

### Build Artifacts:
After the build process is completed, CodeBuild can output build artifacts (e.g., binaries, packaged applications) that can be stored in Amazon S3 or deployed directly to other services.

### Built-in Security:
CodeBuild integrates with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for managing permissions, enabling you to control access to your build resources securely.

### Environment Variables: 
You can define environment variables th
